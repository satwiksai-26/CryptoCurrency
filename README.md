What is Algorithmic Trading?

Basically, algorithmic trading is the concept whereby computers automatically perform trading activity within the stock market. The idea here is that a computer or 'program' will act upon the instructions that can be from a set of rules: 'If this, then that'; 'What price to trade at'; and even down to 'How much to trade'.

How does it work?

In other simple words, the computer is told what to do and it does it without human intervention. This may make trading faster and more effective since computers are well capable of processing data and doing trades much faster than humans could.

Is algo-trading the same as High-Frequency Trading?

Not exactly. While these terms are often used interchangeably, they mean something different. High-frequency trading, or HFT, is one type of algorithmic trading characterized by a large amount of trading in a very small time frame; it can even be as small as milliseconds. It is a very fast pace of algotrading, although it is not the only one.

What about black-box trading?

The most typical term associated with algotrading might be black-box trading, which hints that the rules and logic of the trading system are not revealed to the user of that system. You may not know in a black-box system how the decisions are being made. That could be a little riskier. It still is a form of algorithmic trading because it has pre-programmed instructions.
